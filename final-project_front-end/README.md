## How the App Started    

The FINDERS KEEPERS application was created during a 4 week project. It’s aim was to solve a problem. 
The problem this app aimed to solve can be split into two sections:   
#### - Too much information
During our consumer research, before app creation, we found that consumers were overwhelmed by all of the information out there when they were trying to book a holiday. They had way too many tabs open and felt they had to hold a lot of information between webpages to inform their decision
We set out to solve this by creating an app that could store all the information you would need in one place. This is the first purpose of FINDERS KEEPERS
#### - Profit influenced information
Whilst doing our research to source the best information for our new application we discovered a second problem; profit influenced the information websites provided. We found that websites seemed to avoid tougher topics like crime or possible negatives to travel in order to sell you their travel guides for example.
This gave us a unique opportunity.
We didn’t need to make profit. Heck, we didn’t even need to make a penny! We decided to take this as a bonus and focus on showing the truthful information - unedited and unbiased.
To achieve this we didn’t cherry pick our information and decided to display it to users as is. Giving our users full confidence in our information.


## How to use the App

FINDERS KEEPERS was designed to be simple to use.    
 - On the home page you will find a search bar. Enter the country you’d like to visit to get all the unbiased information you need about that destination to best inform your decision.   
 - Log in with Google or create an account to be able to save your favourite destinations to your profile page so you can easily jump back to them!

## Roadmap

#### - Checklist: 
we are working on adding a checklist feature to each saved location so you can be sure you have all you need before you travel!

#### - City search: 
We are planning to widen the search from Countries to Cities. You will be able to search for any major cities and find the same detailed information as you could find when searching for a country.

#### - Place of Interest: 
After the city search, we planned to add places of interest on the map together with famous turist attractions.

#### - Travel planner:
Once the city search and places of interest are implemented, the next step is to add a trafic planner.
This would allow you plan your travel by public transport or car within the city to reach your planned destinations.
